# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a
# string with a different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace
# 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'
# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and
# replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print
# each modified line to the screen.
# 10-3. Simpler Code: The program file_reader.py in this section uses a temporary
# variable, lines, to show how splitlines() works. You can skip the temporary
# variable and loop directly over the list that splitlines() returns:
# for line in contents.splitlines():
# Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section,
# to make them more concise.
