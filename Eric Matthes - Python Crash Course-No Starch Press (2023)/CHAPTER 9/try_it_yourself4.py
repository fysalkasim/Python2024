# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
# instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of
# customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print
# the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number
# you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of
# business.
